# `thegamma-sql-service`

A ["REST pivot data service"](http://thegamma.net/publishing/) for [The Gamma](http://thegamma.net)

## Installation

Get [JRuby](http://jruby.org).

- `bundle`
- `JRUBY_OPTS="-G" rackup`

By default, the service connects to an example SQLite database which contains the [olympic medals dataset](https://github.com/the-gamma/thegamma-services/blob/master/data/medals-expanded.csv) used in the examples. It should also work with any database supported by [ActiveRecord JDBC](https://github.com/jruby/activerecord-jdbc-adapter).
